# Basics of HTML Technical Documentation

This project is being created to fulfill the requirements of [Build a Technical Documentation Page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-technical-documentation-page) project in the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Responsive Web Design certification.

In this project, I implemented a theme-switcher using only CSS so a user can switch from dark to light theme.
